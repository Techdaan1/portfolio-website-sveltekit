    <p class="about-subtitle">
      I am a career changer, vegetarian, mum of three, Dutch but I live in
      Germany, love to travel and enjoy doing sports. Long story short: I am a
      busy bee! Workwise I like to challenge myself all the time, I am used to
      work with tight deadlines, am stress-resistent (you have to when you are a
      mum :D) and love to work in teams because it makes you stronger as you can
      learn from each other. My background is in Marketing, but that never felt
      like the right fit. I like to see the logic behind things and since I
      started as a developer it all just really makes sense. &#10084;
